The project involves a complex water transport system through the Drukm√°kori Desert, channeling water from mountain springs to city cisterns via a network of pipes. 

This system comprises straight pipes and active elements such as mountains, cisterns, and solar-powered pumps. Each pump can connect multiple pipes but operates only one input and one output at a time. Pumps can fail randomly, stopping the water flow, and each pump has a tank for temporary water storage.

Maintenance workers repair pumps, adjust the system for maximum water flow, and patch leaks, while also expanding the network using new pipes produced at the cisterns. Nomadic saboteurs interfere by altering pump settings and creating leaks.

Both teams navigate solely through the pipeline network, with workers striving to maximize water delivery to the cisterns and saboteurs aiming to cause water loss. The game, played by two teams of at least two players each, is won by the team that secures the most water by the end.
